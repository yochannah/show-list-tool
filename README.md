InterMine steps tool to show a list.

## Developing

To install the dependencies:

    npm install && bower install

To run the server:

    npm start

The terminal will tell you which port the server is running on. The default is 8080, but it'll increment to the next available port if 8080 is taken.

This module doesn't use any build processes for the JS or CSS - it's all pure vanilla code, without any grunting or gulping. So just serve and modify your code to your heart's content.
